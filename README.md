# Application development


## Description

This is  a web application of recipe finder done using html, css and javascript

This code was done in visual studios using the template ASP.NET core empty that is I took visual studios as a html editor

The main set up of my code is that to save the file and then open the saved file in any browser which would lead you to my website.

My code could also be run in any other html editor
